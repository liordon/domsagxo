A public repository for the Domsaĝo interpreter: a scripting language interpreter based on the Esperanto language. 
Domsaĝo (or Domsagxo in x-notation Esperanto, for ascii usage) allows you to program your smart home in a simple imperative manner, allowing you to manipulate simple commands and compose convenient routines. 
You could think of it simply as a scripting language for your smart home or personal assistant. More on this story as it develops.
